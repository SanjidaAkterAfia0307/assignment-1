                    <p> Today you have eaten from the largest restaurant in the country and slept peacefully in an incredibly comfortable room in a store building. But do you know that an illiterate brother or sister of your age, who could not acquire literacy due to poverty, has come from a distant village in the hope of handing over food to his family once a day? Your half-eaten food would be picked up by street children. Do you know why? Because they are still in the darkness of ignorance. They are starving today, they are shameless today because they are homeless. Let us get out of the palace of happiness and help them to build a house of happiness.</p>
                       <p> And with this thought, we started to walk on this path. At first, this journey started with about 50 volunteers. We now have a team of 300 full-time volunteers and about 500 half-time volunteers. The smile on the face of the poor people after handing over the necessary items to them is our source of inspiration.
