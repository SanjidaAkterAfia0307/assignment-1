                    <p>Today you have eaten from the largest restaurant in the country and slept peacefully in an incredibly comfortable room in a store building. But do you know that an illiterate brother or sister of your age, who could not acquire literacy due to poverty, has come from a distant village in the hope of handing over food to his family once a day? Your half-eaten food would be picked up by street children. Do you know why? Because they are still in the darkness of ignorance. They are starving today, they are shameless today because they are homeless. Let us get out of the palace of happiness and help them to build a house of happiness.</p>

                    <p>And with this thought, we started to walk on this path. At first, this journey started with about 50 volunteers. We now have a team of 300 full-time volunteers and about 500 half-time volunteers. The smile on the face of the poor people after handing over the necessary items to them is our source of inspiration.

                <p>Our main priority is serving people fresh food, pure water and education. So, we have divided our programs into three sections - 1. Food, 2.Shelter and 3.Education. We are trying our best to eradicate illiteracy and malnutrition in rural areas of Bangladesh.</p>

                        <p>Every day we waste about 15 million tons of food. On the other hand, there are 30 million people who pass their day without food. Our principle is to serve the people with fresh food, medicine and care. We launch our food donation program twice a month in about 2136 villages in Bangladesh. We provide primary medical treatment and medicine as well to eradicate malnutrition from the rural region. Especially, we launch many more campaigns in natural calamity-affected areas.</p>

We provide the unprivileged with the necessary materials for building a proper shelter for every person. Our members are always trying to arrange the components to make a living place for the poor. We launch special programs in natural calamity-affected areas to confirm a safe place.</p>

                                    We provide the children with every element that are necessary for education. Our organization has found about 50 primary schools in rural areas. We have launched the "Food for Education" program. We are also trying to start nightshift schools and adult education.</p>
