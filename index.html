                <p>Our main priority is serving people fresh food, pure water and education. So, we have divided our programs into three sections - 1. Food, 2.Shelter and 3.Education. We are trying our best to eradicate illiteracy and malnutrition in rural areas of Bangladesh.</p>

                        <p>Every day we waste about 15 million tons of food. On the other hand, there are 30 million people who pass their day without food. Our principle is to serve the people with fresh food, medicine and care. We launch our food donation program twice a month in about 2136 villages in Bangladesh. We provide primary medical treatment and medicine as well to eradicate malnutrition from the rural region. Especially, we launch many more campaigns in natural calamity-affected areas.</p>

We provide the unprivileged with the necessary materials for building a proper shelter for every person. Our members are always trying to arrange the components to make a living place for the poor. We launch special programs in natural calamity-affected areas to confirm a safe place.</p>

                                    We provide the children with every element that are necessary for education. Our organization has found about 50 primary schools in rural areas. We have launched the "Food for Education" program. We are also trying to start nightshift schools and adult education.</p>
